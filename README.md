## Requirements

This website was made as a freelance job for a prominent physician and scientist, Dr. Eric Wexler, who asked for an exact replica of his current website ericwexlermd.com. The only difference is that he wanted his new site to be made of clean code, and to be mobile friendly. All the HMTL and CSS was remade here.
